Used the mA mH array provided and some "out of the box" neural network tools to better understand the data given and pull out what network might be better

results, 3 layer deep, adam algorithm, relu activated neurons, 64 neurons per node seems to give the best results

randomly filling in the mA mH of the background makes the parameters correlate with the label which is undesirable, learning from random choices from the signal is better but
the ability to interpolate is reduced

Proposed concept of using a GAN instead to get around these problems.

Came up with concept of mapping mA,mH space as a function of likelihood to pass the network average over all other parameters to determine the interporability of the result
